This software is beerware.

If we meet, you owe me a beer. Maybe two. Or even three.

Do whatever you want with this software, but:

If you want to make money out of it, you have the right to do so,
but you have to inform the Original Author *before* you do.

If you modify the software, you have to advertise the "Original Author"
somewhere in a visible place into your modified version
(the Original Author yearns for glory).

Enjoy!
